# ASECourseWork
## Repo for the ASE coursework

## Naming Conventions:
  For common objects (buttons, text fields etc) please prefix these with the object type.
  For example for the log in button name the object "btnLogin"
              for the username label name the object "lblUser"
              
## Branching Conventions:
  All changes should be created in a branch. Branches can be created through GIT, Ternimal, or IDE.
  If unclear on how to do this ask or check out the GIT tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches
  Branches should be reviewed and approved by at least one other member of the team before they are merged into master branch.
  
## Testing Conventions:
  Modules should all have unit tests written (and passing) before a pull request is raised for the branch.
  Testing framework will be discussed 03/12/2021 in the lab, once this discussion has taken place I will update this with the frame work details.
