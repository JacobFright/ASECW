Branching conventions:
  All changes should be created in a branch. Branches can be created through GIT, Ternimal, or IDE
  If unclear on how to do this ask or check out the GIT tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches

  Modules should all have unit tests written for the (and passing) before a merge request is raised for the branch.
